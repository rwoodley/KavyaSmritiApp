in 02-HanumanChalisa/Workshop there is a file HanumanChalisa.pdf.
It contains the text of the Hanuman Chalisa.
there is 4 introductory verses, then the 40 verses of the Chalisa, followed by 2 concluding verses.
For each verse, the text is 1) listed in Devanagiri, then 2) there is a transliteration into english, finally 3) there is an english translation.
please extract all of the verses into separate files. 
The intro verses should be named Intro01, Intro02, etc.
The 40 Chalisa verses should be named Verse01, Verse02, etc.
The final concluding verses should be Named Outro01, etc.
So for each Intro/Verse/Outro there will be 3 files:

VerseXX.transliteration
VerseXX.english 

Create these fils and put them in 02-HanumanChalisa/Data.
Since there are 46 verses, there should be 138 files created.
